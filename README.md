# Stars Express Way v0.3.5

## Author
**Version:** 0.3.5  
**Author:** Neal Brandon Jr  
**Website:** [www.nealsdevsite.com](https://www.nealsdevsite.com)

## Purpose
**Stars Express Way** is an interactive relativistic star simulation designed to:
- Demonstrate the visual effects of relativistic travel, such as redshift, blueshift, and the narrowing field of view.
- Provide an engaging visual representation of how stars appear at various speeds.
- Serve as both an educational and entertaining tool for exploring physics and relativity.

## Features
- Adjust speed from 0% to 100% of the speed of light.
- Toggle between forward and reverse views to observe redshift and blueshift effects.
- Dynamic star density for customizable visuals.
- Responsive design for optimal performance on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structuring the webpage and rendering the canvas.
- **CSS3**: Styling the interface and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core logic for animations, user controls, and relativistic calculations.
- **Canvas API**: For rendering stars, simulating motion, and applying effects.

## How to Use
### Requirements
- A modern web browser that supports HTML5 Canvas (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Steps
1. Download or clone this repository.

2. Due to CORS restrictions and the use of JavaScript modules, these files cannot be run directly as local files.
- To run this application, you need to use one of the following methods: 

Option 1: Run with a Local Server

- Use a lightweight local server such as:

-- Python: Run python -m http.server in the project directory and access the app via http://localhost:8000.

-- Node.js: Use tools like http-server or live-server.

-- XAMPP/WAMP: Place the project files in the server's root directory and access the app via your browser.

Option 2: Deploy to a Web Server

- Upload the project files to a web hosting service.

Option 3: Use a CORS Proxy

- If you cannot use a server or hosting service, consider using a CORS proxy to bypass CORS restrictions.
-- However, this is not recommended for production due to potential security and performance concerns.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
4. Use the on-screen controls to:
   - Increase or decrease speed.
   - Switch between forward and reverse views.
   - Adjust star density.
